Collections::::
____________________________
____________________________
Drawbacks of Arrays
1.length of array is fixed.
2.stores only homogeneous elements.
3.It is not under any data structers,we have write logic for any operation manually.

To overcome these Drawbacks COLLECTIONS CONCEPT is introdued.
ArrayList<Integer> a1=new ArryaList<>();
a1.add(5);
a1.add(52);

collection:
To store the Elements.

Collections::To  perform the operations

Collectionn.max(a1);//output:::52
Methods of Collections
Collections.sort(list);
Collections.copy(l1,l2);//TO COPY ONE LIST INTO ANOTHER LIST
Collections.shuffle(LIST);//REAARANGE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE LIST
Collections.reverse(LIST);//TO REVERSE THE ELEMENTS IN THE LIST
Collections.min(LIST);//RETURNS THE MINIMUM ELEMENT IN THE LIST;

Collection framework:::
defines several classes and interfaces used to represent group of objects as a single entity
List Interface
[ArrayList,LinkedList,Vector,Stack]
Queue  Interface
[PriorityQueue]
SetInterface
[HashSet,LinkedHashedSet,TreeSet]

Properties
in List insertion order is preserved.
inList duplicates are allowed.
Heterogeneous elements are allowed.
Null insertion is possible.
